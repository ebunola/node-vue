                <i>The acronym ABCON depicts Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria.</i>
              </p>
              <p class="p-16">
                The historical background of ABCON dates back to 4th of February, 1997 when its 
                registration was approved by the Corporate Affairs Commission (C.A.C).  It came 
                into being from a vision of some bureaux de change operators numbering more 
                than 50(fifty) in an attempt to create an environment of sanctity in the business of 
                foreign exchange. Hither-to, the country-Nigeria was experiencing an economic 
                recession which emanated from the restrictions placed on foreign exchange by a 
                government policy named "Structural Adjustment Program" (SAP) prevalent in the 
                '80s.

           The government of the day in an attempt to ration the scarce foreign exchange in circulation introduced measures to restrict access to it through an outright ban on some 
           transactions in the official foreign exchange market and brought in rigorous documentation.
    
           
         </p>
         <p class="p-16 pb-5">
           This created a huge demand for foreign exchange outside government approved sources. It also marked the beginning of the black market or the parallel market. 
           Moreover, the tighter restrictions on the activities at the parallel market gave rise to an increasing problem of naira instability which by implication resulted to economic 
           inflation. Furthermore, in an attempt to stall the unfavourable trend of naira instability and inflation, the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2006 brought in operators of bureaux 
           de change in the country into the official market, with the objective of encouraging them to buy at official exchange rate and sell to end-users within an approved margin. 
           From a humble beginning of about 50 members in 1989 under the pioneering head, then called the Chairman of the committee, Chief Paul Ehiri and other pioneering 
           members that included Late Dr.John Anaza, Mr. Moses B. Adeisa, Mr. James O. Tifase and Alhaji Suleiman Farouk, the association has grown from strength to strength with 
           a membership numbering above 3000 as at date.With this numerical strength and spread, the association is poised to fulfil its objective of working closely with CBN to 
           meet the public’s yearning for a legitimate business in foreign exchange.

                Sequel to this, the Country's apex bank introduced Cash sale of dollars to Bureaux  
                De Change Operators. This new method was encapsulated in the "FURTHER   
                MEASURES TO LIBERALISE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET IN NIGERIA”,   
                introduced in March 2006 and which came in to effect from April same year.    
                Moreover, with the official empowerment of Bureaux De Change Operators in the   
                country to see to the sale and purchase of foreign exchange, the stage was set for    
                operators in the financial sector to operate more effectively. This has been a major    
                boost to the relevance of ABCON in Nigeria’s financial sector.
